## Actipy installation

Set up a virtual environment with python 3.10 (tested).

To install java for actipy on the iMacs, use homebrew:
```shell
brew install java
```

And then, follow the suggestion from homebrew and run:
```shell
sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk
```
